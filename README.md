With standard supervised learning for Image Net,

You have 1 millon images, you randomly select a mini batch of 64, and you make prediction

The problem I am interested in solving is that of a baby, which is born and learns to make a helpful contribution to the world.

mini-batch = 1

Each data is time-series

How can we use this to our advnatage?

Idea 1.

Predictive learning. (see Yan Lecunn)

- quick feedback loop (t + 1)
- Rich feedback, 1000x1000 pixels vs 1 scalar value for RL
- No human labelers (Save on $$$)
- Requires understanding of structure of data. See LLMs - "And the murderer was ..."

Big Issue is that standard neuron has no sense of time/state.

I want to make a change to the fundamental unit of the nueral network (for modular effects like transitor, etc.)

Nueron = wx + b

P Nueron = wx + b - ke


 Time-series data.

 There is a strong coorelation between previous prediction error and current prediction

 We are trying to track reality.
